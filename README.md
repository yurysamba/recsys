Last Recommender System Project I worked on: the implementation of Mikolov's paper Word2Vec for any items. 
Assuming that we are able to generate a dataset that contains a set of target, context items.
This template can be used to train the NN that will learn the embeddings for the items. 
These embeddings can then be used to return other similar items or in clustering analysis to generate segmentations of the population based on the items they interacted with.
